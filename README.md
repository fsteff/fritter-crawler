experimental fritter crawler

## Usage
run using <br>`npm start`.
<br><br>
If there exists a file users.json, it initializes using this file, else it starts with the user Fsteff and then traverses all users it can find.
It then updates users.json for each user it finds and exits when it is finished.

For now it only looks at profile.json, maybe when I have the time I add more features.
